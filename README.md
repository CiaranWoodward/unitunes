# unitunes

A command-line interface tool to manage playlists across music streaming services.

## Introduction

unitunes is designed to keep playlists in sync across multiple streaming services.

unitunes defines Universal Playlists (UPs), a service agnostic representation of a playlist. UPs are the source of truth for playlists on streaming services. UPs are stored as plain text JSON, enabling them to be checked into version control systems.

The unitunes CLI tool provides a command-line interface to manage UPs. Playlists can be pushed and pulled from streaming services. unitunes automatically searches for missing tracks.
